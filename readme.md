# Blog Project Setup Instructions

This is a Blog Project set up with the help of json-server. Follow the instructions below to get it working correctly.

## API Setup

1. Navigate to the `api` folder using the command line: (`cd api`)

2. Install all dependencies: (`npm i`)

3. Start the JSON server to use the API to fetch the data: (`npm run dev`) This command runs a script created inside the `package.json` file under the `api` folder, starting the server.

## Project Setup

1. After starting the server, navigate to the `blog-project` directory: (`cd blog-project`)

2. Install the dependencies inside the `blog-project` directory: (`npm i`)

3. Start the project:
   This command runs a script just like the one in the `api` directory, starting the project. (`npm run dev`)

4. Once the server and project are started, you can view the project live by opening the following link in your browser:
   [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

Note: You may need to `cmd + click` or `cntrl + click` the link generated from this command.
